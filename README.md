# auto-QEC-CSS-codes
The algorithm presented here is for automating the circuit generation for the detection and error correction schemes for any single Pauli error for a class of quantum error correction codes called CSS codes. The only input parameters needed are an encoding scheme and the number of qubits in that scheme. Test encoding encoding are also available. The master document is a Jupyter file intended to walk through how to use the code for those who may be unfamiliar with quantum error correction. This algorithm was created with the hope that researchers, regardless of experience level, can use it to easily test novel encoding schemes or hardware fidelity. 

This algorithm was developed as part of a research effort conducted at Western Illinois University under the advisement of Kishor T. Kapale, with the bulk of the code developed by Chelsie Hadley (this author) and significant contributionss from Pradip Bhattarai (https://www.linkedin.com/in/pradip-bhattarai-baba0b214/) and Maliq Adetunji (https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-maliqadetunji/).
